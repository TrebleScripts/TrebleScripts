Hey, I’m Treble — a professional Roblox scripter with 3+ years of experience and hundreds of hours spent mastering the platform.

I specialize in building complete, production-ready systems such as:

🧳 Inventory frameworks with GUI + saving

⚔️ Frame-based combat with animation syncing

🎰 Gacha summoning systems with pity + auto-sell

🧠 Turn-based AI logic with grid-based movement

I have a deep understanding of the Roblox API and a strong grasp of best practices used by top studios. While I don’t handle animations or VFX directly, I’m capable of scripting nearly any gameplay or backend system from the ground up.

I don’t just write scripts that work — I build systems that are modular, scalable, and designed for long-term content expansion. I focus on performance, readability, and reliability.

I'm a fast, detail-oriented learner who values:

Clear communication

Clean, maintainable code

Systems that are easy for teams to build on

If you're looking for a professional scripter who works with purpose and polish — you've found the right person.
